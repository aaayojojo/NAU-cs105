- [X] Commit 2 (Updating the README) :+1:
- [X] Commit 3 (Putting text in this MD) :rocket:
- [X] Commit 4 _**(Edited this with new fun stuff)**_
- [X] Commit 5 (Came back and tried to fix errors I saw in this file. It is getting a bit chaotic)
- [X] Bonus 1 (Tried to fix my header)
- [X] Bonus 2 (Fixed a "to" to a "so")
- [X] Bonus 3 (Came to Update the file list)

- [X] Merge 1 (Created Cool.md in CoolBranch and tried to put an image in it)

**Don't Really know what else to edit so I am going to edit this. Also there is a back to this booklet called Markdom Syntax so expect to see that.**
